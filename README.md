# -UFC-314-Alexander-Volkanovski-vs-Diego-Lopes-Rise-

These 2 guys are going to fight Diego Lopes in the main event of on April 12, 2025, at the Kaseya Center in Miami. The bout is for the vacant UFC featherweight title after Ilia Topuria vacated his title to move up to lightweight. This is a crucial fight for both fighters -- Volkanovski to reclaim his former glory and Lopes for his first UFC championship.
Alexander Volkanovski's
Record and Recent Form: Volkanovski (26-4) is the former UFC featherweight champion, holding the belt for more than four years and successfully defending it five times. But he’s coming off consecutive knockout defeats — first to Islam Makhachev in October 2022 at lightweight, and more recently to Ilia Topuria in February 2023 at featherweight. It will be his first fight in more than a year, after a 14-month layoff.
Motivation: Volkanovski, 36 years old, has admitted that this could be his final shot at recapturing the title. He has leaned into an “Old Man Volk” persona, hoping to show he can still hang with the best of the best. He retains the confidence that he can outlive younger opponents with experience and tactics.

Record and Momentum: Lopes (26-6) has won five in a row, including upsets against Dan Ige and Brian Ortega. A hard-hitting stylist with a relentless approach, Lopes has quickly made his way up the featherweight leaderboard and didn’t even make his UFC bow until just under two years ago.
Fighting Style: Lopes mixes power striking with world-class jiu-jitsu and can be a threat to finish on the feet and on the mat. Questions about his cardio still hover over him, but he showed progress in his most recent fights.
Victory
For Volkanovski: It will only be through Volkanovski leaning on his footwork and process these experts say in wearing down Lopes cardio. Steering clear of early exchanges, where Lopes is most dangerous, will be crucial, especially given Volkanovski’s toughness came in for a bit of scrutiny after a knockout loss in his last fight, and two losses by way of KO.
For Lopes: Lopes needs to take advantage of Volkanovski's recent struggles with blunt force by keeping pressure early and forcing Volkanovski backwards. His capacity to blend striking with grappling might create problems for Volkanovski, too.
Highlights
The UFC 314 card is one of the year’s most stacked events:
Co-Main Event: Michael Chandler vs. Paddy Pimblett in a lightweight fight.
Other notable fights include Yair Rodriguez vs. Patricio Pitbull (featherweight), Jean Silva vs. Bryce Mitchell (featherweight) and Geoff Neal vs. Carlos Prates (welterweight).
This bout is a battle of generations: Volkanovski’s legacy and experience vs. Lopes’ youthful momentum and desire for gold. The result will not only determine the next featherweight champion, but it will also likely set the course for the rest of both men's future careers.
